# ld52

## Controls

- Movement: arrow keys
- Jump: space, or x
- Throw warpball: hold z to charge

## Build Instructions

ld52 is a Haskell project, which means you're going to need a Haskell toolchain
to compile it. First, install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/)
and then run

```bash
$ stack run
```

which will kick off a long build and eventually start the game!
